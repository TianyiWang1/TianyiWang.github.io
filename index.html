							<h1>About me </h1>
						</header>
						<p>Hello, it's a pleasure to have you visit my personal homepage üëã!<br /><br />
							I am a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical and Electron Engineering at the School of Engineering at University of Western Australia. I completed my undergraduate study in automation at Southwest University in 2023 Fall.My research interests include Robotics, Embedded Development and Artificial Intelligence.<br /><br />
							Recently, I am study at UWA, and everything is totally different. So I'm trying to adjust to a new life and seeking for some new opportunities.<br /><br />
							I was engaged in the development of robots related to the DJI RoboMaster competition at the GKD Robotics Innovation Laboratory of Southwest University during 2020-2023.I have also presided over many innovation and entrepreneurship projects, such as robot public welfare education and disinfecting storage robots, etc., responsible for design and coordination.<br /><br />
